Example Article
CiCo: Domain-Aware Sign Language Retrieval via Cross-Lingual Contrastive Learning

This work focuses on sign language retrieval—a recently proposed task for sign language understanding.
Sign language retrieval consists of two sub-tasks: text-to-sign-video (T2V) retrieval and sign-video-to-text (V2T) retrieval.
Our framework, termed as domain-aware sign language retrieval via Cross-lingual Contrastive learning or CiCo for short, outperforms the pioneering method by large margins on various datasets.

Expected Output
{
  "domains": ["Machine Learning", "Contrastive Learning", "Sign Language Retrieval"],
  "glossary": {
      "T2V": "text-to-sign-video",
      "V2T": "sign-video-to-text",
      "CiCo": "domain-aware sign language retrieval via Cross-lingual Contrastive learning"
  }
}
