## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (Flask)
- **PDF Processing**: Extracts text from uploaded PDFs
- **LLM Integration**: Uses OpenAI GPT for document analysis and term explanation

### Frontend (Next.js + React)
- **PDF Viewer**: Continuous scroll with zoom controls, selectable text via Text Layer
- **Explain Panel**: Shows what you highlighted and the explanation with source + domain
- **Glossary Tab**: Browse the full glossary; clicking a term triggers explanation
- **Auto Glossary**: Glossary is fetched after upload without an extra click
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### 5. Using the Application

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Upload a PDF file (research paper, article, etc.)
3. Wait for the document to be processed; the glossary loads automatically
4. Scroll and zoom in the PDF on the left
5. Highlight any text ‚Äî the Explain tab (right) shows the selected text and its definition
6. Switch to the Glossary tab (right) to browse all terms; click a term to explain it

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Backend Development

The backend is built with Flask and includes:

- **PDF Processing**: Uses `pypdf` for text extraction
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT for document analysis
- **Data Models**: Pydantic models for type safety
- **CORS Support**: Configured for frontend integration

**Key Files:**
- `app/main.py`: Flask application and API endpoints
- `app/llm.py`: LLM integration and document analysis
- `app/pdf_io.py`: PDF text extraction
- `app/models.py`: Pydantic data models
- `app/store.py`: In-memory data storage

### Frontend Development

The frontend is built with Next.js and includes:

- **PDF Viewer**: React-PDF for document display with continuous scroll + zoom
- **Interactive Highlighting**: Custom selection handling within the PDF container
- **Explain/Glossary Panel**: Tabbed right panel for explanations and glossary browsing
- **API Integration**: Axios for backend communication
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS for styling

**Key Files:**
- `frontend/pages/index.tsx`: Main application page and layout
- `frontend/components/PdfReader.tsx`: Scrollable, zoomable PDF viewer with text selection
- `frontend/components/ExplainPanel.tsx`: Shows selected text and explanation
- `frontend/components/GlossaryPanel.tsx`: Glossary display and term selection
- `frontend/components/Tabs.tsx`: Simple tabs for the right panel
- `frontend/lib/api.ts`: Backend API integration

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Academic Research**: Quickly understand technical papers
- **Student Learning**: Get instant explanations for complex terms
- **Professional Development**: Stay current with industry terminology
- **Document Analysis**: Extract key concepts from research papers

## üîß Configuration

### Backend Configuration

- **File Upload Limit**: 16MB maximum
- **Supported Formats**: PDF only
- **LLM Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo (configurable)
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds for LLM operations

### Frontend Configuration

- **PDF Worker**: Uses CDN-hosted PDF.js worker. If your environment blocks CDNs, switch to a local worker import in `frontend/components/PdfReader.tsx`.

## üß≠ User Experience Overview

- Upload a PDF; the app extracts text and analyzes it for domains and glossary terms.
- The PDF renders on the left. You can scroll through pages and adjust zoom.
- Highlight any word or phrase in the PDF:
  - If the term exists in the document glossary, the Explain tab shows that definition immediately.
  - Otherwise, the app asks the AI to explain it in context and shows the result.
- The right panel has two tabs:
  - Explain: shows the selected text and a clear explanation with source and domain.
  - Glossary: list of all extracted terms. Clicking a term switches back to Explain with its definition.

Tip: There‚Äôs a small server status indicator in the header so you know the backend is reachable.
- **API Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile-first design

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Not Loading**: Ensure the PDF has selectable text (not scanned images)
2. **API Connection Failed**: Check that the backend is running on port 5001
3. **OpenAI API Errors**: Verify your API key and account credits
4. **CORS Issues**: Ensure the backend CORS is properly configured

### Debug Mode

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python app/main.py
# Debug mode is enabled by default
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Development mode with hot reload
```
